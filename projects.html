            <h4>Description</h4>
            <p>The goal of this project is to create a map of technologies that are related to Data Analytics. This includes 
                database technolgies, data processing technologies and data visualization tools. I hope to gather some insight into how those technologies are used in the real world, 
                and how the application of certain technologies change over time. Technologies should appear close to each other on the
                map if they are often named together by people discussing those technologies. 
                Technologies are generally named together when discussing alternatives  (HBase, Cassandra) or if 
                they are often used together (HBase, Phoenix). The ML/AI technology that is going to serve as foundation for this project is word embedding.
                Basically, word embedding algorithms like word2vec assign a vector to every word in a text corpus. The vectors of words that often appear together will be close to
                each other in the vector space. Here is a basic description of how a typical <a href="https://pathmind.com/wiki/word2vec">algorithm for word embeddings</a> works.
                I originally got the idea when working at a consultancy where we programmed an Artificial Intelligence that would make suggestions
                 on which consultant should be staffed on a given project.
                In order to generate suggestions, we mapped all available consultants in a high dimensional vectorspace. The vector of each individual
                consultant was dependent on their CV and the Skills that they possessed. We then generated a vector for each consulting project in
                the same vectorspace and calculated the consultants that were closest. (This is a simplified version of how the final product worked)
                For this project, instead of mapping all words found in a text corpus into the vector space, I will map only technologies that I have specified before.
                Those technologies can consist of single or multiple words.

                <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;">
                    As a data source, I need a large amount of text in which the application of technologies that are interesting to us are described.
                    Ideally, the data would be diverse in the way that different Analytics/ML/AI Use Cases are described.
                    As a first data scource, I am going to use posts and 
                    comments from reddit.com.<br>
                    Reddit.com is a network of communities based on people's interests.
                    There are several subreddits, which make up subcommunities in which people share content and ask questions.
                    Other members of a subreddit can see and comment on the posts. <br>

                <p style="font-weight: bold; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 0px;">Analytics</p>
                <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;">
                    Since the raw data that I am going to use is not structured in any way, I am going to extract the technologies that are named in a very simple way.
                    I am going to write a json file with technologies that I want to include in my analysis. For each technology, I am going to
                    specify aliases (Spark = Spark2, vue = vue.js, S3 = Simple Storage Service) and the corresponding technology family (Spark: Analytics, MongoDB: Database).
                    Using aliases assures that I do not create two different embeddings for the same technology, and that I don't miss the appearance of a technology 
                    in the text.
                    I will then look through each post and through each comment and find out if the technologies that I have specified apppeared in the post/comment.
                    This has one major drawback: Some technolgies that I would like to include have names that correspond to English words, such as 
                    the Javascript framework React. A possible way around would be to have a Natural Language Processing model
                    analyze which of the words or groups of words in the comments or posts correspond to a named entity (Basically, which of the words are names).
                    I will experiment with ways to deal with the drawback later, and will ignore "problematic" technolgies in the first version of the technology map.
                    When the data is structured, and all posts and comments are converted into lists of technologies that were mentioned in the respective post or comment,
                    I am going to use a word embedding algorithm like word2vec to map the technologies into a vectorspace. <br>
                    <i class="fa fa-angle-right" style="color:red; padding-top: 5px; font-size: 24px;"></i> Extract technologies by using a structured list of technologies
                    to look for in comments and posts, then use word2vec to generate embeddings for the technologies.

                </p>
                <p style="font-weight: bold; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 0px;">Visualization</p>
                <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;">
                    In general, Natural Language Processing models use a vectorspace for the embedding of words or phrases that is high-dimensional, typically in the hundreds.
                    I do not need to map the large number of words, that languages normally use, into a vectorspace. Therefore, the vectorspace of this project will be much smaller
                    in terms of its dimensionality. In my past experience, the optimal number of dimensions for a vectorspace that had to contain 1000-2000 different vectors was 
                    in the range of 10-20. My technology map will have an even smaller number of technolgies taken into account (especially the first version) so the dimensionality necessary
                    to get good results is probably very low.
                    If we want to visualize the entire map, we would have to find a way to plot all technologies in two dimensions for example by using <a href="https://gephi.org/">Gephi</a>. 
                    <br>
                    <i class="fa fa-angle-right" style="color:red; padding-top: 5px; font-size: 24px;"></i> Use basic visualizations to test if our model is working.
                    For example, test which are the technologies closest to a given test technology and visualize the distance of each of the resulting technologies to our
                    test technology (maybe just use a basic table). If results are good, see how low we can go in terms of the vectorspaces dimensionality.

                <h5>Implementation</h5>
                <p>14.05.2020</p>
                <p> I used the <a href="https://pushshift.io/api-parameters/" target="_blank">pushlift API</a> to acess Reddit's data.
                    I chose to include posts and comments from the subreddits "MachineLearning", "webdev", "bigdata", "datascience", "analytics" and "ArtificialInteligence". 
                    I decided to use data from the last 2 years, to get a somewhat recent view on things. I also decided only to include posts and 
                    comments that have as least as many likes as dislikes. This might be overcautious, since most of the time the comment
                    was probably not downvoted because the technologies named should not appear together. Under the given requirements
                    (subreddit, time, vote) I get more than 70.000 posts and more than 900.000 comments with a content that contain more than 15 characters.
                    There are two ways how the data can be used:<br>
                    1: Treat every post and every comment individually. This would mean that I count two technologies as appearing
                    together only if they appear in the same post/comment. 
                    2: Combine contents of a post and its comments. Either "globally", by just combining all of their contents or 
                    by building several "local" combinations, in which each comment would be combined only with its father comment (which 
                    could be the original post).<br> 
                    I will start by first analyzing each post and each comment individually, since it appears more
                    straightforward. A post or content has an effect on the outcome of the model, if at least two different technologies appear in it. Of 
                    the more than 1 million posts and comments, only about 22.000 contained at least two of the technologies that I searched for (the list of technologies
                    that are searched for are listed in the "technologies.json" file in the 
                    <a href="https://github.com/HannoMaximilian/AnalyticsTechnologyMap" target="_blank">projects repository</a>).
                    The following heatmap shows, how often two technologies appeared together in a post or comment. Note that many constellations appeared
                    much more than 20 times.

                <p>For the embedding of the words I used 
                    <a href="https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/models/word2vec.html", target="_blank">Gensim's implementation of Word2Vec</a>. 
                    Each technology was treated as a word in a sentence.
                    The "sentence" was the collection of technologies that were named in a comment or post. 
                    The word2vec algorithm allows the user to define the number of dimensions that the vector space is going to have.
                    After trying out different numbers of dimensions, I decided that the best results were achieved with three to four dimensions.
                    To visualize the embedding space, I used the t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding algorithm implemented in
                    <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.manifold.TSNE.html" target="_blank">sklearn.manifold.TSNE</a>
                    to reduce the dimensionality of the word vector to just two dimensions which I was then able to plot.
                    The "perplexity" parameter of the t-SNE algorithm can easily be optimized by comparing the resulting vizalization to 
                    the technologies that are listed as closest to each other when using Gensims most_similar() function.

                <p>The visualization indicates that the posts and comments from reddit hold usefull information about the investigated technologies.
                    The combination of word2vec and t-SNE was able to retrieve and visualize the underlying information. <br>
                    The relative position of most of the technologies makes sense intuitively. Most database technologies are close to each other,
                    as are visualization tools. There is one group which mainly consists of Big Data processing technologies (all the Apache stuff, Dask, Flink)
                     and another group which consists mainly of computing platforms (Amazon Lightsail, AWS, Google Clud Platform, Azure). The computing platform
                     Amazon EMR is much closer to the processing technologies than to the other computing platforms. A reason could be that Amazon EMR is 
                     used for the processing of Big Data, and it might appear more often in the processing setting than in the platform setting.
                     The location of technology family names 
                     that I included in the analysis (Database, SQL Database, NoSQL Database, Cloud, Big Data, Machine Learning, Visualization) appears to make sense as well.<br>
                     Locations that were surprising to me are:
                </p>
                    <ul>
                     <li>Amazon Sagemaker and Qlik being quite far off</li>
                     <li>d3.js being so much closer to the visualization tools than to the Javascript frameworks</li>
                     <li>Microsoft Access bein so close to the visualization tools</li>
                     <li>SQL and NoSQL technologies being so close to each other</li>
                    </ul>
                <p>
                    Although the relative position of most technologies makes sense, it is not possible to understand where the position comes from.
                    Are two technologies close to each other because they often appeared together in a post/comment, or just because they often appeared
                    together in a post/comment with the same third technology?<br>
                    In the next version of the visualization, I want to include edges between the nodes that show how often the two connected nodes/technologies 
                    have appeard together in a sentence. It would also be interesting to set the size of the nodes relative to how often the respective technology appeared
                    altogether.

                    Visualize edges between nodes/technologies, whose thickness indicate how often the two 
                    corresponding technologies appeared together. If the selected visualization implementation allows it,
                    adjust the size of the nodes dependent on how often the respective technology has appeared in total.
                    It would also be interesting to colour the nodes dependent on the technology family that the respective
                    technology belongs to (Database, Cloud, Visualization...).

                <p>16.05.2020</p>
                <p>
                    I found an <a href="https://github.com/rweng18/midsummer_network", target="_blank">example online</a>
                    , where somebody created a network of the characters appearing in Shakespears play "A Midsummer Night's Dream" based on 
                    how often each two characters appear together in a scene.
                    I decided to use the same visualization technique. The first version of the technology map showed that it is possible to visualize
                    the map in 2D. Following the given example, I used the
                    <a href="https://networkx.github.io/documentation/networkx-1.9/reference/generated/networkx.drawing.layout.spring_layout.html" target="_blank">
                    spring_layout from networkx</a> to generate the position of the nodes for the second version of the map. Instead of first mapping the technologies in a high dimensional
                    vector space and then reducing the dimensionality for the visualization, the spring_layout algorithm will calculate the distribution of the technologies
                    in 2D directly. In order to calculate each technologies/nodes location, it is necessary to define how "stong" the edge between each two nodes is. 
                    The stronger the edge, the closer the two linked nodes are to each other in the visualization. Using the actual number of coappearances as 
                    the strength of the edge makes all technologies that come up very often appear close to each other in the center of the map. To generate the shown map,
                    I used a kind of relative importance:<br>
                    <i>edgeweight_tech1_tech2 = (coappearances / appearances_tech1) + (coappearances / appearances_tech2)</i><br> 
                    I also set a threshold of 0.15 for the edgeweight. If the edgeweight between two technologies was smaller than the threshold, the
                    edge was neither visualized, nor was it taken into account when calculating the position of the nodes.

                        The size of the nodes has been set based on the squareroot of how often the respective technology 
                        apeared in all comments and posts. If a node is double the size of another node, its technology appeared 
                        four times as often. Note that not every actual appearance of a technology in a post or comment is 
                        recognized as such by my "technology extraction pipeline". When people talk about React.js, they often 
                        just write React. Since react is also a verb, I am currently just counting appearances of React.js. 
                        The Cloud Service group of technologies is consisting mainly of Amazon services. 
                        Google and Azure services often do not have a specific name, such as Amazon's S3 or EC2. This makes it 
                        harder to detect the mentioning of a Azure or Google Service. 
                        The color of the nodes is based on the type of technology. For some technologies, 
                        it was difficult to decide which family they belonged to. DynamoDB for example is an Amazon Cloud Service,
                        but also a Database. For a zoomable version of the map,
                        please click on the image.

                        The second version of the technology map gives much more insight into how the technologies 
                        are discussed on reddit. After using a different method to place the technologies in the 2D plot,
                        we see groups that are similar to the groups that we saw in the first version of the technology map 
                        (Database, Big Data Processing, Visualization and BI). Some technologies are not part of the new version,
                        because I increased the minimum number of appearances for a technology to have to be included.

            <p>I built this static website using mainly HTML and Bootstrap with just very little custom CSS. If I want to include a web app in the future
                I will deploy a microservice and keep the static part constant. A very helpful resource to understand the Bootstrap 4 grid 
                layout <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmPmwdshCMw" target="_blank">is this video on youtube</a>. All html and the css file of this website
