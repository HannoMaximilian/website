            <h4>Description</h4>
            <p>The goal of this project is to create a map of technologies that are related to Data Analytics. This includes 
                database technolgies, data processing technologies and data visualization tools. I hope to gather some insight into how Technologies are used in the real world, 
                and how the application of certain Technologies change over time.Technologies should appear close to each other on the
                map if they are often named together. Technologies are generally named together when discussing alternatives  (HBase, Cassandra) or if 
                they are often used together (HBase, Phoenix). The ML/AI technology that is going to serve as foundation for this project is word embedding.
                Basically, algorithms like word2vec assign a vector to every word in a text corpus. The vectors of words that often appear together will be close to
                each other in the vector space. Here is a basic description of how a typical <a href="https://pathmind.com/wiki/word2vec">algorithm for word embeddings</a> works.
                I originally got the idea when working at a consultancy where we programmed an Artificial Intelligence that would make suggestions
                 on which consultant should be staffed on a given project.
                In order to generate suggestions, I mapped all available consultants in a high dimensional vectorspace. I then mapped each project in
                the same vectorspace and calculated the consultants that were closest. (This is a simplified version of how the final product worked).

                <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;">
                    As a data source, I need a large amount of text in which the application of technologies that are interesting to us are described.
                    Ideally, the data would be diverse in the way that different Analytics/ML/AI Use Cases are described.
                    As a first data scource, I am going to use posts and 
                    comments from reddit.com.<br>
                    Reddit.com is a network of communities based on people's interests.
                    There are several subreddits, which make up subcommunities in which people share content and ask questions.
                    Other members of a subreddit can see and comment on the posts. <br>

                <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;">
                    Since the raw data that I am going to use is not structured in any way, I am going to extract features in a very simple way.
                    I am going to write a json file with technologies that I want to include in my analysis. For each technology, I am going to
                    specify aliases (Spark = Spark2, vue = vue.js, S3 = Simple Storage Service) and the corresponding technology family (Spark: Analytics, MongoDB: Database).
                    Using aliases assures that I do not create two different embeddings for the same technology, and that I don't miss the appearance of a technology 
                    in the text.
                    Then look through each post and through each comment and find out if the technologies that I have specified apppeared in the post/comment.
                    This has one major drawback: Some technolgies that I would like to include have names that correspond to English words, such as 
                    the programming language Go and the Javascript framework React. A possible way around would be to have a Natural Language Processing model
                    analyze which of the words or group of words in the comments or posts correspond to a named entity (Basically, which of the words are names).
                    I will experiment with ways to deal with the drawback later, and will ignore "problematic" technolgies in the first version of the technology map.
                    When the data is structured, and all posts and comments are converted into lists of technologies that were mentioned in the respective post or comment,
                    I am going to use a word embedding algorithm like word2vec to map the technologies into a vectorspace. <br>
                    <i class="fa fa-angle-right" style="color:red; padding-top: 5px; font-size: 24px;"></i> Extract technologies by using a structured list of technologies
                    to look for in comments and posts, then use word2vec to generate embeddings for the technologies.

                </p>
                <p style="font-weight: bold; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 0px;">Testing and Visualization</p>
                <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;">
                    In general, Natural Language Processing models use a vectorspace for the embedding of words or phrases that is high-dimensional, typically in the hundreds.
                    I do not need to map the large number of words, that languages normally use, into a vectorspace. Therefore, the vectorspace of this project will be much smaller
                    in terms of its dimensionality. In my past experience, the optimal number of dimensions for a vectorspace that had to contain 1000-2000 different vectors was 
                    in the range of 10-20. My technology map will have an even smaller number of technolgies taken into account (especially the first version) so the dimensionality necessary
                    to get good results is probably very low.
                    If we want to visualize the entire map, we would have to find a way to plot all technologies in two dimensions for example by using <a href="https://gephi.org/">Gephi</a>. 
                    <br>
                    <i class="fa fa-angle-right" style="color:red; padding-top: 5px; font-size: 24px;"></i> Use basic visualizations to test if our model is working.
                    For example, test which are the technologies closest to a given test technology and visualize the distance of each of the resulting technologies to our
                    test technology (maybe just use a basic table). If results are good, see how low we can go in terms of the vectorspaces dimensionality. If d=2 still gives good
                    enough, try out Gephi.

            <p>  I used the <a href="https://pushshift.io/api-parameters/" target="_blank">pushlift API</a> to acess old reddit data.
                I chose to include posts and comments from subreddits "MachineLearning", "webdev", "bigdata", "datascience", "analytics" and "ArtificialInteligence". 
                I decided to use data from the last 2 years, to get a somewhat recent view on things. I also decided only to include posts and 
                comments that have as least as many likes as dislikes. This might be overcautious, since most of the time the comment
                was probably not downvoted because the technologies named should not appear together. Under the given requirements
                (subreddit, time, vote) I get more than 70.000 posts and more than 900.000 comments with a content that contain more than 15 characters.
                There are two ways how the data can be used:<br>
                1: Treat every post and every comment individually. This would mean that I count two technologies as appearing
                together only if they appear in the same post/comment. 
                2: Combine contents of a post and its comments. Either "globally", by just combining all of their contents or 
                by building several "local" combinations, in which each comment would be combined only with its father comment (which 
                could be the original post). I will start by first analyzing each post and each comment individually, since it appears more
                straightforward. A post or content has an effect on the outcome of the model, if at least two different technologies appear in it. Of 
                the more than 1 million posts and comments, only about 9000 contained at least two of the technologies that I searched for (the list of technologies
                that are searched for are listed in the "technologies.json" file in the 
                <a href="https://github.com/HannoMaximilian/AnalyticsTechnologyMap" target="_blank">projects repository</a>)
